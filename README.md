### Welcome Fellow Coders!! ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Michael and recent I finished 3 Full stack web based programming courses from Coding Dojo!!! I finally finished in Febuary 2022. This was my first step 
into making my dream come true. I have always wanted to work with computers. And be able to create my own things with code. 
I have enjoyed coding for a long time now, But never really had any formal training. Mostly it has been a little bit here and there..
I use to play this game that seems like a long time ago.. " Starseige: Tribes "
  I really looked up to some of the mod maker back then, and was really easy to look at the code and follow along. It was all very
well commented code. Even the game it's self had well commented code. That was back in the late 90's.
  Before that was a old IBM with the little flashing white line on the screen. Just trying to find a game on there was madding for me.
First of all I had to teach myself to be able to read to even start. After that it was all i could do but text based games on there. One's where 
your map was posted on the wall next to you. Would drive you nuts when you typed " item compass" 2 or 3 times. Just realize it was a spelling error that made 
it not work for you. Even better, When you would want to go north and realize you read the map and area wrong, and end up dead.
